<purpose>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution. Orchestrator stays lean — delegates plan execution to subagents.
</purpose>

<core_principle>
Orchestrator coordinates, not executes. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context. Orchestrator: discover plans → analyze deps → group waves → spawn agents → handle checkpoints → collect results.
</core_principle>

<required_reading>

<step name="initialize" priority="first">
Load all context in one call:

**If `phase_found` is false:** Error — phase directory not found.
**If `plan_count` is 0:** Error — no plans found in phase.
**If `state_exists` is false but `.planning/` exists:** Offer reconstruct or continue.

|------|-------|----------------|

| 2 | 01-03 | ... |
```
</step>

<step name="execute_waves">
Execute each wave in sequence. Within a wave: parallel if `PARALLELIZATION=true`, sequential if `false`.

**For each wave:**

1. **Describe what's being built (BEFORE spawning):**

   Read each plan's `<objective>`. Extract what's being built and why.

   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N}

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {2-3 sentences: what this builds, technical approach, why it matters}

   Spawning {count} agent(s)...
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Executing terrain generation plan"
   - Good: "Procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise — creates height maps, biome zones, and collision meshes. Required before vehicle physics can interact with ground."

2. **Spawn executor agents:**

   Pass paths only — executors read files themselves with their fresh 200k context.
   This keeps orchestrator context lean (~10-15%).

   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type="gsd-executor",
     model="{executor_model}",
     prompt="
       <objective>
       Execute plan {plan_number} of phase {phase_number}-{phase_name}.
       Commit each task atomically. Create SUMMARY.md. Update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md.
       </objective>

       <execution_context>
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-plan.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/summary.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/checkpoints.md
       @~/.claude/get-shit-done/references/tdd.md
       </execution_context>

       <files_to_read>
       Read these files at execution start using the Read tool:
       - Plan: {phase_dir}/{plan_file}
       - State: .planning/STATE.md
       - Config: .planning/config.json (if exists)
       </files_to_read>

       <success_criteria>
       - [ ] All tasks executed
       - [ ] Each task committed individually
       - [ ] SUMMARY.md created in plan directory
       - [ ] STATE.md updated with position and decisions
       - [ ] ROADMAP.md updated with plan progress (via `roadmap update-plan-progress`)
       </success_criteria>
     "
   )
   ```

3. **Wait for all agents in wave to complete.**

4. **Report completion — spot-check claims first:**

   For each SUMMARY.md:
   - Verify first 2 files from `key-files.created` exist on disk
   - Check `git log --oneline --all --grep="{phase}-{plan}"` returns ≥1 commit
   - Check for `## Self-Check: FAILED` marker

   If ANY spot-check fails: report which plan failed, route to failure handler — ask "Retry plan?" or "Continue with remaining waves?"

   If pass:
   ```
   ---
   ## Wave {N} Complete

   **{Plan ID}: {Plan Name}**
   {What was built — from SUMMARY.md}
   {Notable deviations, if any}

   {If more waves: what this enables for next wave}
   ---
   ```

   - Bad: "Wave 2 complete. Proceeding to Wave 3."
   - Good: "Terrain system complete — 3 biome types, height-based texturing, physics collision meshes. Vehicle physics (Wave 3) can now reference ground surfaces."

5. **Handle failures:**

   **Known Claude Code bug (classifyHandoffIfNeeded):** If an agent reports "failed" with error containing `classifyHandoffIfNeeded is not defined`, this is a Claude Code runtime bug — not a GSD or agent issue. The error fires in the completion handler AFTER all tool calls finish. In this case: run the same spot-checks as step 4 (SUMMARY.md exists, git commits present, no Self-Check: FAILED). If spot-checks PASS → treat as **successful**. If spot-checks FAIL → treat as real failure below.

   For real failures: report which plan failed → ask "Continue?" or "Stop?" → if continue, dependent plans may also fail. If stop, partial completion report.

6. **Execute checkpoint plans between waves** — see `<checkpoint_handling>`.

7. **Proceed to next wave.**
</step>

<step name="checkpoint_handling">
Plans with `autonomous: false` require user interaction.

**Auto-mode checkpoint handling:**

Read auto-advance config:
```bash
AUTO_CFG=$(node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs config-get workflow.auto_advance 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
```

When executor returns a checkpoint AND `AUTO_CFG` is `"true"`:
- **human-verify** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = `"approved"`. Log `⚡ Auto-approved checkpoint`.
- **decision** → Auto-spawn continuation agent with `{user_response}` = first option from checkpoint details. Log `⚡ Auto-selected: [option]`.
- **human-action** → Present to user (existing behavior below). Auth gates cannot be automated.

**Standard flow (not auto-mode, or human-action type):**

1. Spawn agent for checkpoint plan
2. Agent runs until checkpoint task or auth gate → returns structured state
3. Agent return includes: completed tasks table, current task + blocker, checkpoint type/details, what's awaited
4. **Present to user:**
   ```
   ## Checkpoint: [Type]

   **Plan:** 03-03 Dashboard Layout
   **Progress:** 2/3 tasks complete

   [Checkpoint Details from agent return]
   [Awaiting section from agent return]
   ```
5. User responds: "approved"/"done" | issue description | decision selection
6. **Spawn continuation agent (NOT resume)** using continuation-prompt.md template:
   - `{completed_tasks_table}`: From checkpoint return
   - `{resume_task_number}` + `{resume_task_name}`: Current task
   - `{user_response}`: What user provided
   - `{resume_instructions}`: Based on checkpoint type
7. Continuation agent verifies previous commits, continues from resume point
8. Repeat until plan completes or user stops

**Why fresh agent, not resume:** Resume relies on internal serialization that breaks with parallel tool calls. Fresh agents with explicit state are more reliable.

**Checkpoints in parallel waves:** Agent pauses and returns while other parallel agents may complete. Present checkpoint, spawn continuation, wait for all before next wave.

```
</step>

<step name="close_parent_artifacts">
**For decimal/polish phases only (X.Y pattern):** Close the feedback loop by resolving parent UAT and debug artifacts.

**Skip if** phase number has no decimal (e.g., `3`, `04`) — only applies to gap-closure phases like `4.1`, `03.1`.

**1. Detect decimal phase and derive parent:**
```bash
# Check if phase_number contains a decimal
if [[ "$PHASE_NUMBER" == *.* ]]; then
  PARENT_PHASE="${PHASE_NUMBER%%.*}"
fi
```

**2. Find parent UAT file:**
```bash
PARENT_INFO=$(node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs find-phase "${PARENT_PHASE}" --raw)
# Extract directory from PARENT_INFO JSON, then find UAT file in that directory
```

**If no parent UAT found:** Skip this step (gap-closure may have been triggered by VERIFICATION.md instead).

**3. Update UAT gap statuses:**

Read the parent UAT file's `## Gaps` section. For each gap entry with `status: failed`:
- Update to `status: resolved`

**4. Update UAT frontmatter:**

If all gaps now have `status: resolved`:
- Update frontmatter `status: diagnosed` → `status: resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp

**5. Resolve referenced debug sessions:**

For each gap that has a `debug_session:` field:
- Read the debug session file
- Update frontmatter `status:` → `resolved`
- Update frontmatter `updated:` timestamp
- Move to resolved directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .planning/debug/resolved
mv .planning/debug/{slug}.md .planning/debug/resolved/
```

**6. Commit updated artifacts:**
```bash
node ~/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit "docs(phase-${PARENT_PHASE}): resolve UAT gaps and debug sessions after ${PHASE_NUMBER} gap closure" --files .planning/phases/*${PARENT_PHASE}*/*-UAT.md .planning/debug/resolved/*.md

Cross-reference requirement IDs from PLAN frontmatter against REQUIREMENTS.md — every ID MUST be accounted for.
Create VERIFICATION.md.",
  subagent_type="gsd-verifier",
  model="{verifier_model}"
)
```

Read status:
```bash
grep "^status:" "$PHASE_DIR"/*-VERIFICATION.md | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' '
```

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `passed` | → update_roadmap |
| `human_needed` | Auto-verify items first, then present only truly human-required items |
| `gaps_found` | Present gap summary, offer `/gsd:plan-phase {phase} --gaps` |

**If human_needed — Auto-Verification Sub-Step:**

Before presenting items to the user, the orchestrator attempts to programmatically verify as many `human_needed` items as possible. Many items flagged by the verifier (file existence, CLI output, import checks) can be auto-verified — only truly human-only items should require manual verification.

**1. Parse human_verification items from VERIFICATION.md frontmatter:**

```bash
# Extract the human_verification section from VERIFICATION.md frontmatter
# Each item has: test, expected, why_human
```

The verifier outputs structured items:
```yaml
human_verification:
  - test: "What to do"
    expected: "What should happen"
    why_human: "Why can't verify programmatically"
```

**2. Classify each item by its `why_human` field:**

Check the `why_human` text against these signal sets to determine if auto-verification is possible:

**Auto-verifiable signals** (attempt programmatic check):
- Contains "file", "exists", "content" → check file existence/content with Read/Grep
- Contains "CLI", "command", "output", "runs" → execute command and check output
- Contains "import", "export", "module" → grep for import/export patterns
- Contains "endpoint", "route", "API", "returns" → curl/fetch and check response
- Contains "build", "compile", "lint" → run build/lint command

**Truly human-only signals** (skip auto-verification):
- Contains "visual", "appearance", "look", "style", "layout", "design"
- Contains "UX", "feel", "intuitive", "usability", "flow"
- Contains "real-time", "animation", "transition", "responsive"
- Contains "external service", "third-party", "browser"
- Contains "subjective", "preference", "judgment"

**Default:** If `why_human` doesn't match either signal set, keep as human-needed (conservative).

**3. For each auto-verifiable item, attempt verification:**

Use the `test` and `expected` fields to construct a programmatic check:

```bash
# Example: why_human contains "file" or "exists"
# → Use Read tool to check file existence, Grep to check content

# Example: why_human contains "CLI" or "command"
# → Run the command in Bash, check output against expected

# Example: why_human contains "import" or "export"
# → Grep for import/export patterns in source files

# Example: why_human contains "endpoint" or "route"
# → If server can be started, curl the endpoint and check response
# → If not, grep route definitions and handler implementations

# Example: why_human contains "build" or "compile"
# → Run the build/lint command and check exit code
```

Record each result as `auto_passed` (check succeeded) or `auto_failed` (check did not match expected).

**4. Triage results into three buckets:**

- `auto_passed`: Items that were auto-verified successfully — report as evidence but do not require human action
- `auto_failed`: Items that failed auto-verification — these become gaps, not human items
- `still_needs_human`: Items whose `why_human` matched human-only signals (or matched neither set)

**5. Determine final status based on triage:**

| still_needs_human | auto_failed | Final Status |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|
| empty | empty | Escalate to `passed` → route to `update_roadmap` |
| empty | has items | Treat as `gaps_found` → route to gap closure |
| has items | empty or has items | Present reduced list to user (see step 6) |

**6. Present the reduced verification request to the user:**

If ALL items auto-verified (no `still_needs_human` and no `auto_failed`): skip human presentation entirely, flow to `update_roadmap` (same as `passed` status).

If `still_needs_human` is empty but `auto_failed` has items: route to the `gaps_found` handler below.

Otherwise, present the reduced list:

```
## Phase {X}: {Name} — Human Verification Required

{If auto_passed items exist:}
### Auto-Verified ({N} items passed programmatic checks)
| # | Test | Evidence |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | {test description} | {what the auto-check found} |

{If auto_failed items exist:}
### Auto-Verification Failures ({N} items)
| # | Test | Expected | Actual |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | {test description} | {expected} | {what was found instead} |
These items will route to gap closure after human verification completes.

### Human Testing Required ({M} items)
{Only the still_needs_human items from VERIFICATION.md}

"approved" → continue | Report issues → gap closure
```

**If gaps_found:**
```
## ⚠ Phase {X}: {Name} — Gaps Found

**Score:** {N}/{M} must-haves verified
**Report:** {phase_dir}/{phase_num}-VERIFICATION.md

Parse `--no-transition` flag from $ARGUMENTS.

**If `--no-transition` flag present:**

Execute the transition workflow inline (do NOT use Task — orchestrator context is ~10-15%, transition needs phase completion data already in context):

Read and follow `~/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/transition.md`, passing through the `--auto` flag so it propagates to the next phase invocation.

**If neither `--auto` nor `AUTO_CFG` is true:**

Probe next phase state to determine routing:
```bash
