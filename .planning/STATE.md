## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
See `.planning/milestones/v2.1-ROADMAP.md` for v2.1-specific decisions.

Key research findings for v2.2:
- Co-planners are external process invocations, not subagents (bash, not Task tool)
- Zero new npm dependencies -- child_process.execSync in gsd-tools.cjs
- Co-planners run first (refine), adversary runs second (challenge) at shared checkpoints
- All 3 CLIs support non-interactive JSON output

Key decisions from 06-01:
- Each adapter embeds classifyError inline -- self-contained with zero cross-dependencies
- Default timeout 120000ms matches config co_planners.timeout_ms -- single source of truth
- Zero new npm dependencies -- Node.js stdlib only (child_process, fs, path, os)

Key decisions from 06-02:
- Used existing --raw convention instead of new --json flag -- consistent with all gsd-tools.cjs commands
- Kill switch defaults to false (disabled) -- co-planners are opt-in until workflows explicitly enable
- No install.js changes needed -- existing recursive copyWithPathReplacement handles adapters/ subdirectory

Key decisions from 07-01:
- VALID_CHECKPOINTS matches adversary checkpoints: requirements, roadmap, plan, verification
- Null checkpoint = global query (no warning); invalid checkpoint = warning + empty agents
- filterValidAgents uses warn-and-continue pattern (invalid names skipped with warning, not error)

Key decisions from 08-01:
- Temp file approach for prompt construction -- avoids shell quoting issues with embedded artifact content
- Write tool (not Edit) for artifact modification -- consistent with new-project.md allowed-tools
- Display name mapping for agent attribution: codex->Codex, gemini->Gemini CLI, opencode->OpenCode
- Same acceptance criteria framework for both checkpoints: accept/reject/note with clear thresholds

Key decisions from 08-03:
- plan-phase.md uses ${PHASE} for dynamic co-planner commit scope (matches step 2 variable)
- execute-phase.md uses {phase} for dynamic co-planner commit scope (matches existing template pattern)
- Domain-specific acceptance criteria: plan-phase checks logical gaps/dependency conflicts; execute-phase checks missed cases/false positives

Key decisions from 08-02:
- Plan checkpoint synthesis uses Write tool (Edit not in plan-phase.md allowed-tools)
- Verification checkpoint synthesis uses Edit tool (Edit is in execute-phase.md allowed-tools)
- Verification co-planner section skips on gaps_found and re_verification, matching adversary skip conditions

Key decisions from 09-02:
- Replaced per-agent sequential loops with single invoke-all calls -- reduces invocation complexity from O(N) sequential to one parallel batch
- Synthesis organized by theme not by agent -- prevents redundant information when multiple agents raise the same concern
- Bracket-tag attribution inline [Agent1, Agent2] -- preserves source traceability without per-agent sections
- Source(s) column added to synthesis table -- enables at-a-glance attribution tracking

Key decisions from 09-01:
- Used child_process.exec (callback-based async) not execSync-in-Promise -- true parallelism requires non-blocking I/O
- invokeAsync always resolves (never rejects) -- consistent with sync invoke error schema
- Temp file includes CLI_NAME + Date.now() + random suffix to prevent collisions during parallel execution
- invoke-all reads prompt from --prompt-file to avoid shell quoting issues with large artifacts

Key decisions from 10-01:
- Detection runs once when co-planners toggled to Yes, cached results reused for all 5 agent option blocks
- Badge text: "(installed)", "(not installed)", "(status unknown)" -- three-state mapping from detect JSON
- Minimal co_planners defaults (enabled: false, timeout_ms: 120000) -- no agents/checkpoints keys in default config
- Deep merge for co_planners follows established workflow merge convention in cmdConfigEnsureSection

### Pending Todos
