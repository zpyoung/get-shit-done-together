## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Made In | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Stateless rounds | 01-01 | Simpler implementation, forces artifact/defense to be self-contained |
| Advisory role | 01-01 | Adversary informs, orchestrator decides - prevents gridlock |
| Minimum one challenge | 01-01 | "Nothing is perfect" - ensures adversary always provides value |
| Constructive tone | 01-01 | "Potential risk..." phrasing reduces defensive responses |
| Adversary opt-out | 02-01 | Missing config = system defaults; adversary always runs unless explicitly disabled |
| Node-e config parsing | 02-01 | Polymorphic checkpoint values (boolean/object) need real JSON parser, not grep |
| Three-tier precedence | 02-01 | checkpoint max_rounds > adversary max_rounds > system default (3) |
| Simple toggle in new-project | 02-02 | Keep onboarding simple; granular settings available via /gsd:settings |
| Preserve defaults when disabled | 02-02 | Both paths write full adversary section so re-enabling keeps preferences |
