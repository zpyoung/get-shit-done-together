### Decisions

See `.planning/milestones/v2.1-ROADMAP.md` for v2.1-specific decisions.

Key research findings for v2.2:
- Co-planners are external process invocations, not subagents (bash, not Task tool)
- Zero new npm dependencies -- child_process.execSync in gsd-tools.cjs
- Co-planners run first (refine), adversary runs second (challenge) at shared checkpoints
- All 3 CLIs support non-interactive JSON output

### Pending Todos

- **Automate full phase lifecycle with agents** (area: commands)
- **Add phase-specific context files to GSD workflow** (area: workflows)

### Blockers/Concerns
