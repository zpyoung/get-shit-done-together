# Requirements: v2.1 Adversary Agent

**Defined:** 2026-01-31
**Milestone:** v2.1 Adversary Agent
**Core Value:** Unchallenged assumptions get caught before they cause problems in execution

## v2.1 Requirements

### Agent Core

- [x] **AGENT-01**: Adversary uses constructive stance ("Potential risk..." not "This is wrong") — Validated
- [x] **AGENT-02**: Adversary classifies objections by severity (BLOCKING / MAJOR / MINOR) — Validated
- [x] **AGENT-03**: Adversary adapts focus based on checkpoint type (requirements vs roadmap vs plan vs verification) — Validated

### Convergence

- [x] **CONV-01**: Debate terminates after max 3 rounds regardless of state — Validated
- [x] **CONV-02**: Debate uses adaptive convergence detection to exit early when stable — Validated

### Integration

- [x] **INTG-01**: Adversary challenges REQUIREMENTS.md after creation in /gsd:new-project — Validated
- [x] **INTG-02**: Adversary challenges ROADMAP.md after creation in /gsd:new-project — Validated
- [x] **INTG-03**: Adversary challenges PLAN.md after creation in /gsd:plan-phase — Validated
- [x] **INTG-04**: Adversary challenges verification conclusions in /gsd:verify-work — Validated

### Configuration

- [x] **CONF-01**: Global toggle enables/disables adversary in config.json — Validated
- [x] **CONF-02**: Max rounds is configurable in config.json — Validated
- [x] **CONF-03**: Individual checkpoints can be toggled on/off in config.json — Validated

## Future Requirements (v2.2+)

Deferred to future releases. Tracked but not in current milestone.

### Advanced Critique

- **ADV-01**: Structured 5-dimension critique framework (assumptions, feasibility, completeness, logic, risk)
- **ADV-02**: Challenge history tracking across rounds within a checkpoint
- **ADV-03**: Cross-checkpoint consistency tracking (issues raised in requirements tracked through verification)

### Calibration

- **CAL-01**: Intensity calibration (routine vs high-stakes phases)
- **CAL-02**: Challenge rate metrics and tuning

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Different model for adversary | Adds complexity; advisory-only design mitigates same-model collusion risk |
| User-mediated dispute resolution | Claude makes final decisions; adversary is advisory |
| Blocking behavior | Adversary never blocks progress; informs only |
| Integration with gsd-debugger | Separate concern; debugging is reactive, adversary is proactive |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| AGENT-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| AGENT-02 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| AGENT-03 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| CONV-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| CONV-02 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| INTG-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| INTG-02 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| INTG-03 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| INTG-04 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| CONF-01 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| CONF-02 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| CONF-03 | Phase 2 | Complete |
