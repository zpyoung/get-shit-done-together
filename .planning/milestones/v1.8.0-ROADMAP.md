# Milestone v1.8.0: Quick Mode

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Quick mode adds a fast-path command (`/gsd:quick`) that executes small tasks with full GSD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking) but skips optional verification agents. Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Command

**Goal**: User can run `/gsd:quick` and have it execute with full state tracking
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Quick command file with pre-flight validation and directory setup
- [x] 01-02: Quick orchestration (planner spawn, executor spawn, state update)

**Details:**
- Created `/gsd:quick` command file with proper frontmatter
- Implemented ROADMAP.md validation with clear error messaging
- Added interactive description prompt using AskUserQuestion
- Implemented slug generation and sequential numbering for quick task directories
- Implemented gsd-planner spawn with quick mode context
- Implemented gsd-executor spawn with no-ROADMAP constraint
- Added STATE.md Quick Tasks Completed table creation/update logic
- Added final commit pattern and GSD-style completion output

### Phase 2: Documentation

**Goal**: Quick mode is documented in all relevant locations
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Document /gsd:quick in help.md, README.md, and GSD-STYLE.md

**Details:**
- help.md Quick Mode section with command usage, purpose, and output files
- README.md Quick Mode section in How It Works plus Utilities table entry
- GSD-STYLE.md Quick Mode Patterns section with when-to-use, structure, tracking, orchestration, and commit conventions

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- No planner changes — Quick mode is orchestrator-level, not agent-level
- No decimal phases — Quick tasks don't need ROADMAP integration
- No flags for MVP — Simplest possible interface
- Quick Tasks table in STATE.md — Better tracking than just Last activity
- Orchestration inline in command — No separate workflow needed

**Issues Resolved:**
- Token efficiency for simple tasks (50-70% reduction)

**Issues Deferred:**
- `/gsd:resume-work` decimal phase handling (deferred to future)
- `/gsd:squash-quick` for consolidating fragmented quick tasks

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
